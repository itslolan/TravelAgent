# 🐛 Frontend Debug Fix - Search Button Not Working

## The Problem

When clicking "Search Flights" on the deployed Render.com version:
- Form doesn't proceed to results page
- Shows input fields again
- No console logs visible

## The Fix

Added comprehensive logging to debug the issue:

### Frontend Logging (App.jsx)
```javascript
// Before fetch
console.log('🚀 Starting search with:', requestBody);
console.log('🌐 API URL:', '/api/search-flights');

// After fetch
console.log('📡 Response status:', response.status, response.statusText);

// On error
console.error('❌ API Error:', errorText);
console.error('❌ Search error:', err);
```

### Backend Logging (flightSearch.js)
```javascript
// When request received
console.log('📨 Received search request:', req.body);
console.log('✅ SSE headers set, mode:', searchMode);
```

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Deploy with Logging

```bash
git add src/App.jsx server/routes/flightSearch.js FRONTEND_DEBUG_FIX.md
git commit -m "Add debug logging for API requests"
git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

After deployment completes:
1. Open your deployed app
2. Open browser DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Click "Search Flights"
5. Look for logs starting with 🚀, 📡, ❌

### Step 3: Check Render Logs

Go to Render Dashboard → Your Backend Service → Logs

Look for:
- `📨 Received search request:`
- `✅ SSE headers set`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to start search: 404"

**Cause**: API route not found

**Fix**: 
```javascript
// Check server/index.js has:
app.use('/api', flightSearchRouter);

// Before the catch-all:
app.get('*', (req, res) => { ... });
```

**Solution**: Routes are correctly ordered in `server/index.js`

---

### Issue 2: "CORS policy" error

**Cause**: Frontend and backend on different origins

**Fix**:
```javascript
// server/index.js already has:
app.use(cors());
```

**Solution**: CORS is already enabled

---

### Issue 3: Network Error / Cannot fetch

**Cause**: Backend not running or wrong URL

**Check**:
```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/health

# Expected response
{"status":"ok"}
```

**Fix**: Ensure backend service is deployed and running on Render

---

### Issue 4: "Content-Type" error

**Cause**: Not receiving text/event-stream

**Check Browser DevTools → Network tab**:
1. Click "Search Flights"
2. Find `search-flights` request
3. Check **Response Headers**:
   - Should have: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`

**Fix**: Already set in `server/routes/flightSearch.js`:
```javascript
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
```

---

### Issue 5: Form shows again immediately

**Cause**: JavaScript error preventing state update

**Check Console for**:
- Red error messages
- "Uncaught" errors
- Stack traces

**Fix**: Look at the specific error and fix the code

---

### Issue 6: White screen / Build error

**Cause**: React build failed

**Check Render build logs**:
```
==> Running build command
> vite build
✓ built in 15.2s
```

**Fix**: Already fixed (moved vite to dependencies)

---

## Debugging Workflow

### 1. Browser Console Shows Nothing

**Problem**: JavaScript not loading

**Check**:
- View page source
- Look for `<script>` tags with `src="/assets/..."`
- Try loading script URLs directly

**Fix**: Ensure `dist/` folder is built and served

---

### 2. Console Shows 🚀 but no 📡

**Problem**: Fetch is failing before getting response

**Possible causes**:
- Network error
- CORS blocking
- DNS issue

**Check Network tab**:
- Status: Should be 200
- Type: Should be `eventsource` or `fetch`

---

### 3. Console Shows 📡 with error status

**Problem**: Server returning error

**Check**:
- Status code (400, 404, 500)
- Error message in console

**Fix based on status**:
- 400: Bad request (check request body)
- 404: Route not found (check API path)
- 500: Server error (check Render logs)

---

### 4. No Errors but Form Re-appears

**Problem**: State not updating correctly

**Check if**:
- `setLoading(true)` is called
- `setLoading(false)` is called too early

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Add to handleSubmit
console.log('Loading state:', loading);
console.log('Results state:', results);
```

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `src/App.jsx`
   - Added logging before/after fetch
   - Improved error handling

2. ✅ `server/routes/flightSearch.js`
   - Added request logging
   - Added mode logging

3. ✅ `FRONTEND_DEBUG_FIX.md` (this file)
   - Complete debugging guide

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add debug logging for production troubleshooting"
git push origin master
```

Wait for Render to redeploy (~3-5 minutes)

### 2. Test on Deployed Site

1. Open https://your-backend.onrender.com
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Fill in search form
4. Click "Search Flights"
5. **Watch console for logs**

### 3. Report Findings

Based on what you see in console:

**If you see** 🚀 logs:
- ✅ JavaScript is loaded
- ✅ Event handler is working
- ✅ Function is executing

**If you see** 📡 with status 200:
- ✅ Backend is responding
- ✅ SSE connection established
- ⚠️  Check if streaming data is received

**If you see** ❌ errors:
- Post the exact error message
- This will tell us what's failing

### 4. Check Backend Logs

Go to Render Dashboard → Backend Service → Logs

**If you see** `📨 Received search request:`:
- ✅ Request reached backend
- ✅ Route handler is running

**If you don't see it**:
- ❌ Request not reaching backend
- Check if backend URL is correct

## Expected Successful Flow

**Console output should be**:
```
🚀 Starting search with: {searchMode: 'fixed', ...}
🌐 API URL: /api/search-flights
📡 Response status: 200 OK
```

**Render logs should show**:
```
📨 Received search request: { searchMode: 'fixed', ... }
✅ SSE headers set, mode: fixed
🌐 Creating BrowserBase session...
```

**Then UI should**:
1. Hide form
2. Show loading state
3. Show live browser session (if available)
4. Show results when complete

## Still Not Working?

If after deploying you still see issues:

1. **Share console output**: Copy ALL console logs
2. **Share network tab**: Screenshot of failed request
3. **Share Render logs**: Copy backend server logs
4. **Share error messages**: Any red error text

This will help diagnose the exact issue!
