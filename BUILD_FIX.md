# ✅ Build Fix - "vite: not found" Error

## The Error

```
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

## The Problem

Render runs `npm install --production` by default, which **only installs `dependencies`** and **skips `devDependencies`**.

Your build tools (vite, tailwindcss, etc.) were in `devDependencies`, so Render couldn't find them during the build step.

## The Solution

**Moved build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:**

### What Was Moved

✅ `vite` - Build tool  
✅ `@vitejs/plugin-react` - React plugin for Vite  
✅ `tailwindcss` - CSS framework  
✅ `postcss` - CSS processor  
✅ `autoprefixer` - CSS vendor prefixing  

### What Stayed in devDependencies

⚙️ `concurrently` - Only needed for local dev  
⚙️ `nodemon` - Only needed for local dev  

## Why This Works

### Before (Broken)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "...",
    "express": "..."
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "...",        // ❌ Not installed in production
    "tailwindcss": "..."  // ❌ Not installed in production
  }
}
```

**Render build process:**
```bash
npm install --production  # Skips devDependencies
npm run build            # Tries to run vite → Not found! ❌
```

### After (Fixed)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "...",
    "express": "...",
    "vite": "...",        // ✅ Installed in production
    "tailwindcss": "..."  // ✅ Installed in production
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "...",     // Only needed locally
    "concurrently": "..." // Only needed locally
  }
}
```

**Render build process:**
```bash
npm install --production  # Installs dependencies (includes vite)
npm run build            # Runs vite → Success! ✅
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push

```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix: Move build tools to dependencies for Render deployment"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Render Will Auto-Deploy

Since auto-deploy is enabled, Render will:
1. Detect the push to master
2. Start a new build
3. Install dependencies (including vite)
4. Build successfully ✅
5. Deploy the app

### 3. Monitor Deployment

Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/) → Your Service → Logs

You should see:
```
==> Installing dependencies
added 500+ packages

==> Running build command
> vite build

vite v5.0.0 building for production...
✓ built in 15.2s

==> Build successful ✅
==> Deploying...
```

## Verify It Works

After deployment completes:

**Backend Health:**
```bash
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected:**
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

**Frontend:**
Visit `https://your-backend.onrender.com` in browser - should see the React app!

## Understanding Dependencies vs DevDependencies

### dependencies (Needed in Production)

**When to use:**
- Required to run the app
- Required to build the app
- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue)
- Backend frameworks (Express)
- Build tools (Vite, Webpack)
- CSS frameworks (Tailwind)

**Examples:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",      // ✅ Runtime
    "express": "^4.18.2",    // ✅ Runtime
    "vite": "^5.0.0",        // ✅ Build time
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.5"  // ✅ Build time
  }
}
```

### devDependencies (Only Needed Locally)

**When to use:**
- Development servers (nodemon)
- Testing tools (jest, vitest)
- Linting (eslint)
- Formatting (prettier)
- Type checking (typescript)
- Local task runners (concurrently)

**Examples:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1",      // ⚙️ Dev server
    "concurrently": "^8.2.2", // ⚙️ Run multiple dev commands
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",       // ⚙️ Linting
    "prettier": "^2.8.0"      // ⚙️ Formatting
  }
}
```

## Alternative Solution (Not Recommended)

You could also change the build command in `render.yaml` to install all dependencies:

```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
# OR
buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
```

But this is **not recommended** because:
- ❌ Installs unnecessary dev tools
- ❌ Slower builds
- ❌ Larger deployment size
- ✅ Moving build tools to dependencies is cleaner

## Summary

✅ **Fixed**: Moved build tools to `dependencies`  
✅ **Why**: Render needs them to build the app  
✅ **Auto-deploy**: Push triggers automatic rebuild  
✅ **Best practice**: Build tools belong in dependencies  

**Your app will now build and deploy successfully!** 🚀
